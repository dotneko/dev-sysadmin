# Software Development & Systems Administration Notes

This is a personal repository of notes, commands, scripts and resources on software development, systems administration, and miscellaneous tidbits of technology wisdom collected from various sources.

It is not intended to be a complete reference or guide, but more as a cheatsheet/archive of links to more comprehensive resources that are available on the Internet.
