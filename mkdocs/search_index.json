            "text": "An old file transfer protocol for exchanging files over a TCP/IP network since the 1970's.  Base specification is  RFC 959 , 1985.  Designed to allow clients to browse the file system, and FTP is a stateful sequence of one or more transactions.  Client is always responsible for initiating requests.  Authentication by username/password; de facto standard for guest access using \"anonymous\" for username and an \"email address\" for the password.  Supports  ASCII  for text and \"image\" for binary data.  Base specification does not have any special handling for encrypted communications, so files containing sensitive material should not be sent.  Usernames and passwords are sent in clear text  and the entire FTP transmission could be monitored by potential attackers.  Instead should instead use something like  scp  for same security as  ssh .   Source:   http://www.ncftp.com/libncftp/doc/ftp_overview.html",
