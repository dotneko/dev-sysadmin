Some journaling file systems can prevent corruption as well by writing the data twice.   Linux file system hierarchy   Central concepts of a file system:  superblock : contains info about the file system as a whole such as size.  inode : contains info about a file, except its name; contains numbers of several data blocks.  name : stored in the directory together with the number of the inode.  directory entry : consists of a filename and the number of the inode.  data blocks : used to store data in the file.  indirect blocks : dynamically allocated blocks that contain additional data for an inode.",

Concepts include roles, rights profiles, authorizations, privileges, and security attributes.  Process rights management is implemented through privileges.  Various superuser capabilities are collected into a  rights profile .  Rights profiles are assigned to special user accounts, called  roles .  One can base roles on rights profiles that have the smae name (e.g. root).",
